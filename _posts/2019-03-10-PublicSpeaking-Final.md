# Finals (Public Speaking)

## How to make a good game?

### Starting with 'the Delivery'

It basically needs two players competing with each other. Each time you hit a car, you reborn in front of the hospital. Each time you pick the food and successfully deliver it to the destination, you earn some points. And the player who earns more points wins.

This game is not published yet and maybe it never will. But the game's demo was displayed by the teaching assistant in his own school in Denmark.

Actually there are a lot to be considered. Characters, hazards, mechanics, dynamics, gameworld and so on. There are too many of them. But there are three most important elements I want to talk about that is __gameplays__, __mechanics__ and finally, the __culture__.

### Gameplays

It is fundamentally the kernel of one game. It defines how to play the game.  All of you should have played the game named 'temple run'. So how to play it? Basically you can turn left or right, you can jump or lie down to  avoid bumping into the tree trunk or jumping into the river. Your goal is to run as far as you can to get as higher score as possible. That's its gameplay. Gameplays are the basis of a game design. Only after you first design how to play the game can you figure out how to make the game.

### Mechanics

Gameplays are important but not the main factor leading to a success, since a lot of games have almost the similar gameplays. Such as King of Glory and Vain Glory. They are all moba games.  You simply control one character and help the team to destroy the crystal. So how can both of the game survive in the game market? Mechanics! Mechanics are the motivations. If you want the player hooked by your game, you have to deliberately consider how to design those mechanics.  So back to the example, the maps are slightly different as you can probably see. There are six wards on the map of the Vain Glory, but there is no wards on the map of the King of Glory. And if the ward is occupied, then you can have the whole view of that particular area. The map of the Vain Glory is much larger than the map of the King of Glory. So commonly it takes a longer time to play one game in the Vain Glory.  There are also gold mines where you can get lots of money from in the Vain Glory.

Above all, mechanics are important and can be deciduous whether the players are attracted by your game or not.

### Culture

Finally, the culture. Back to the greatest game in the world, the 'Delivery'. We design the game not only because it is fun to play and we want to attract lots of players, but also by attracting more players, we can let them know the culture of our own country. We want them to know that being a delivery guy in China is risky and tough. A game without the culture is a man without his soul, a game with the culture is really rock'n roll.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, a good game is like a human. Gameplays are the bones, without them, you cannot move. Mechanics are the appearance, well, in the appearance-oriented society, one cannot deny the fact that the better your looking is, the easier to get popular. Last but not least, culture is the cloth. Well, a person is only a person. But if they dress like this, you will know 'oh, he's the Santa Claus and Christmas is coming'. Neither of them can be omitted, they are all equally important. Thank you!
