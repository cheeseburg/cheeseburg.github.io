### Public Speaking Mid_term

I often hear people say "I can almost feel the fresh sea breeze" after they consume some fresh sea food. However maybe they are just sitting in front of a fan in a restaurant one thousand miles away from the sea. So, why can they possibly feel the sea breeze? A psychologist Charles Spence gives an answer, he says “Our senses are connected in some surprising ways.”  And that makes me thinking, if that's true, what if music can change the taste of a food?

You have heard background music being played in restaurants before. Restaurants often use music to enhance the atmosphere, but can the music also affect the way we taste? The answer is yes! Exposure to different volumes and styles of music actually can change the intensity of sweet and salty foods.

Researchers did an experiment on it. They asked participants to snack on chips while listening to music at either high levels of volume, or in complete silence. They found that the participants who were exposed to the loud music rated the sweet and salty tastes of chips as less intense than participants exposed to complete silence. It's interesting because it means that a higher volume leads to a drop of sweet and salty taste of the same food.

Furthermore, it is not just music has effect on taste, but the way food sounds itself has effect on it as well. Take Pringles as an example. Why Pringles are designed with their unique shapes? Not because they can fit into the package better, but because it results in a louder crunch when bitten into. And this louder crunch can let the consumers perceive the chips as more fresh and crisp.

So next time when you make a meal, remember to add some music recipe. Thank you!
