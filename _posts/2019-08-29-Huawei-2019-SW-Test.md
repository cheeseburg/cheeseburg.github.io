### Count the routes!

---

In a maze, you can walk in the direction of N,S,E or W one step at a time, and you are only allowed to go if the next location has a higher altitude than your current location.

Calculate the remainder, when total # of routes that are from A to B is divided by $10^{9}$.

$\textbf{Sample input:}$

```txt
4 5
0 1 0 0 0
0 2 3 0 0
0 0 4 5 0
0 0 7 6 0
0 1 3 2
```

The first line stands for the size of the maze(separated by one space), which is 4$\times$5.

```txt
4 5
```

The combination of the following M lines builds a M$\times$N matrix, in which, each element stands for the altitude.

```txt
0 1 0 0 0
0 2 3 0 0
0 0 4 5 0
0 0 7 6 0
```

The next line stands for the coordinates of A and B, i.e. (0, 1) and (3, 2).

```txt
0 1 3 2
```

$\textbf{Sample output:}$

```txt

#### Sample Code

```python
def go(a, b, m, cnt, l): # a-current location, b-destination, m-map, cnt-total count
    curr_x, curr_y = a[0], a[1]
    des_x, des_y = b[0], b[1]

    if a == b: # current position is already the destination
        cnt += 1
        l.append(1)

    if curr_x+1 < len(m):
        if int(m[curr_x+1][curr_y]) > int(m[curr_x][curr_y]):
            go((curr_x+1, curr_y), b, m, cnt, l)

    if curr_x-1 >= 0:
        if int(m[curr_x-1][curr_y]) > int(m[curr_x][curr_y]):
            go((curr_x-1, curr_y), b, m, cnt, l)

    if curr_y+1 < len(m[0]):
        if int(m[curr_x][curr_y+1]) > int(m[curr_x][curr_y]):
            go((curr_x, curr_y+1), b, m, cnt, l)

    if curr_y-1 >= 0:
        if int(m[curr_x][curr_y-1]) > int(m[curr_x][curr_y]):
            go((curr_x, curr_y-1), b, m, cnt, l)

    return cnt

if __name__ == '__main__':
    k = []
    l = []
    cnt = 0
    while True:
        try:
            k.append(input())
        except:
            break
    x, y = int(k[0][0]), int(k[0][2])
    m = []
    for i in range(x):
        m.append(k[i+1].split())
    curr = (int(k[x+1][0]), int(k[x+1][2]))
    des = (int(k[x+1][4]), int(k[x+1][6]))
    go(curr, des, m, cnt, l)
    # print(cnt)
    print(len(l)%1000000000)
```

PS. I couldn't return cnt in a right way and failed the test when taking the test. However, after the test, I immediately find out what's wrong. (SO SAD!!!!) 

I simply call a new variable, `l`, into the function `go()`. Each time, when `cnt+1`, `l` is appended. The mechanism behind this is that, while `cnt` is a global integer variable and always be  0 as I defined it, however although `l` is a global variable, but when we do the append operation, it will write in the memory immediately, and therefore be saved in the list.
